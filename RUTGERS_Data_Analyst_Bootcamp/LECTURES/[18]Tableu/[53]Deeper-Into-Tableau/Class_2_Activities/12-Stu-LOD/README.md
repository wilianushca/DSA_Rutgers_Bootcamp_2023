# Level of Detail

In this activity, you will practice creating LOD calculations.

## Instructions

**Part 1**

* With the `Global Superstore` Excel workbook, create a visualization of state-level profits, as in the following image, which visualizes the contribution of each state to the national profit.

**Part 3**

* Create a visualization of state-level profits, as in the following image:

  ![stu_LOD3.png](Images/stu_LOD3.png)

* The label for each state is **not** the total sum of profits in that state. Rather, it is a state-level visualization of the average of the orders.

## Hint

* For this map, you will need to research Tableau LOD syntax. What will you use instead of `EXCLUDE`?
