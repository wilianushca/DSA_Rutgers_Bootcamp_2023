# Unemployment Map

In this activity, you’ll develop more familiarity with map building in Tableau.

## Instructions

* Use `employment.csv`, a dataset constructed from the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, to visualize unemployment in the United States.

* Create a map of unemployment, by county, between 2008 and 2016. Which areas in the United States have been hit hardest during that period?

* Create an unemployment map, by county, for 1990 through 1998. How does it compare and contrast with the 2008-2016 map?

* Create a map of counties with the highest rates of unemployment over the whole dataset. Use Tableau's built-in Census data to discover the relationship, if any, between counties with the highest rates of unemployment and the median per capita income by county.
