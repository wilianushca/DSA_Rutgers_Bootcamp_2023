# Most Fun Neighborhood in NYC?

In this activity, you’ll find the “most fun” neighborhoods in New York City by mapping bars that have received the highest number of noise complaints.

## Instructions

**Part 1**

* Use the provided dataset to create a map of NYC bars, broken down by boroughs.

  * It should show the locations of bars that have been subject to noise complaints.

  * A bar should be proportionately represented by the number of complaints it has received.

  * A bar should also reflect the borough in which it is located.

  * Each zip code in the city should be displayed on the map, as in the following image. Location is everything!
