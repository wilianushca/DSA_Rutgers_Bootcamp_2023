* On the landing page there are four options to choose from:
    * A quick start tutorial to help you create a cluster, attach a notebook to your cluster, create a table for a dataset, query the table using SQL, create a table and a graph, and create a DataFrame.
    * Create a new notebook, like a Jupyter Notebook.
    * Import data
    * Connect to external software, like Tableau, Power BI and many more. **Note:** the Community Edition does not allow connections to external software.

* You can use the quick start tutorial to get familiar with Databricks, or you can use the following steps to get started.

    * Before you create a notebook you have to create a cluster. On the navigation pane on the left side of the landing page, click on the the "+" and select "Cluster".
