# Databricks Basics

In this activity, you will create a Databricks notebook and then perform basic data analysis and visualization by using Python and SQL interfaces.


## Instructions

As a new data analyst at XYZ Corporation, you need to familiarize yourself with the Databricks interface. Your manager has asked you to learn how to upload datasets, perform basic file navigation, and conduct data analysis by using Databricks.

Complete the following tasks:

* Upload `vehicles.csv` and `vehicles.parquet` to Databricks.

* Create a blank Databricks notebook.

* Use `dbutils` to note the location of the CSV.

* Create a Spark DataFrame of the dataset and preview the DataFrame.

* Create a PySpark query to obtain the number of vehicles per sale by manufacturer.

* Create a bar chart of the results.

* Perform the same query and visualization by using SQL. Remember that you will need to create a temporary table.

## Bonus

Complete the following tasks:

* Upload `vehicles.parquet` to Databricks and load only the following columns of the dataset into a Spark DataFrame: year, manufacturer, and transmission.

* Using PySpark, obtain the number of vehicles per sale by manufacturer.

* Create a bar chart of the results.
