# Plotting Bigfoot Data

In this activity, you’ll first use Spark and Pandas to clean a bigfoot time series dataset, and then you’ll create a plot.

## Instructions

1. After loading the bigfoot data into a DataFrame, import the date functions that you’ll need.

2. Create a new DataFrame that contains only the "year" column.

3. Save "year" as a new column.

4. Find the total number of bigfoot sightings per year.

5. Import the summarized data into a Pandas DataFrame for plotting.

6. Clean the data, and rename the "count" column to "sightings".

7. Use Plotly to plot the number of sightings for each year.

    * **Hint:** For help, see [Line Charts in Python](https://plotly.com/python/line-charts/) in the Plotly documentation.
