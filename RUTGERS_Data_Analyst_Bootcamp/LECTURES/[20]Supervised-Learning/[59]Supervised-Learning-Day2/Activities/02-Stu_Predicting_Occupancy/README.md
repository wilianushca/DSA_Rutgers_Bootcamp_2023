# Predict Occupancy of Office Space

In this activity, you'll apply a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict if an office space is occupied based on the office conditions of light, temperature, humidity, and CO~2~. 


## Instructions

* After importing the data, retrieving the target and feature variables, and splitting the data into training and testing datasets, do the following: 

    * Create an SVM linear classifier and fit the model to the data.

    * Compute the model accuracy.
    
    * Calculate the classification report using the testing data.
