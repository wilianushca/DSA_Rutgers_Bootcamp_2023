# Predicting Sales with Linear Regression

## Background

You and some friends created the ultimate child seat. It's a light and water-resistant car seat that can be folded and stored in a backpack; it's the perfect solution for traveling families.

You wanted to spread the word about your invention, so you decided to run a digital marketing campaign using online ads. After running the campaign for a few days, displaying a different number of ads each day, you wanted to create a model to predict the expected sales on any given day, depending on the number of ads you decided to show that day.

You realized that this is an excellent opportunity to use your linear regression skills to create a prediction model.


## Instructions

Use the following steps to create a linear regression model to predict sales based on the historical data provided:

1. Load and visualize the sales data.

2. Prepare the data to fit the linear regression model.

3. Build the linear regression model using the `LinearRegression` module of `scikit-learn`.

4. Plot the best fit line for the sales prediction model.

5. Use the linear regression model to manually predict the sales in the case of 100 ads.

6. Make predictions using the `predict` function of the `LinearRegression` module.
