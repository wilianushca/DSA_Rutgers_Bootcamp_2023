# Predicting Diabetes

In this activity, you will use a logistic regression model to predict whether an individual has diabetes.


## Instructions

1. Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Separate the target (the Outcome column) from the other features.

3. Split the data into training and testing data.

4. Create a logistic regression classifier model. 

    > **Hint:** Use the following parameters: `solver=’lbfgs’`, `max_iter=200`, `random_state=1`.

5. Fit the model to the training data.

6. Print the scores for the training and testing data.

7. Use the testing data to make predictions and compare those to the actual testing data values.

8. Calculate the accuracy score on the predictions. 

> **Hint:** If you get stuck, refer to the instructor demonstration Jupyter notebook for examples of how to complete each step.
