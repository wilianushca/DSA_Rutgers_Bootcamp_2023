# Find Pets

In this activity, you will revisit the data from Petsitly Marketing and practice using comparison operators in MongoDB with PyMongo.

## Instructions

* Navigate to your `Resources` folder in your Terminal and import the Petsitly data again using the following command:

    ```shell
    mongoimport --type json -d petsitly_marketing -c customer_list --drop --jsonArray customer_list.json
    ```

* Use [find_pets.ipynb](Unsolved/find_pets.ipynb) to complete this activity in Jupyter Notebook.

* Create a query that finds the customers who had over 50 visits in 2021 and pretty print the first two results.

* Create a query that finds the customers who spent $250 or less in 2021 and pretty print the first two results.

* Create a query that finds the customer(s) who live in an apartment with "Suite" in the address and pretty print the first three results.

* Create a query that finds the customers who have turtles or fish and pretty print the first three results.

## Hint

* The `$regex` operator is used to match partial strings.

* For the other comparison operators, consult the MongoDB documentation on [comparison operators](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query-comparison/).
