# Regex Wildcards, Sets, and Escaping

In this activity, you’ll use regular expressions to find lines of text that meet specific criteria.

## Instructions

1. Load the "Alice in Wonderland" text into a DataFrame named `alice_df`.

2. Create a regular expression that uses a character set to find all the lines that contain the "cat", "hat", or "eat" string.

3. Create a regular expression that uses a character set to find all the lines that contain the "cat", "hat", or "eat" string and that end with a period (`.`).

4. Create a regular expression that finds all lines that contain a word of the form "w_ll", where the underscore (`_`) is any character.

### Data Source: 

  * `alice.txt` is from [Project Gutenberg eBooks](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and may be used freely in the United States.
