# Regex Special Characters

In this activity, you’ll use special characters to find lines of text that meet specific criteria.

## Instructions

1. Load the *Alice in Wonderland* text into a DataFrame named `alice_df`.

2. Create a regular expression that finds all the lines that start with the 'Alice' string.

3. Create a regular expression that finds all the lines that end with an exclamation point (`!`).

4. Create a regular expression that finds all the lines that end with either an exclamation point (`!`) or a question mark (`?`).

### Data Source: 

* `alice.txt` is from [Project Gutenberg eBooks](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and may be used freely in the United States.
