# Regex Grouping

In this activity, you’ll use capture groups to further refine regex matches.

## Instructions

1. Load the *Alice in Wonderland* text into a DataFrame named `alice_df`.

2. Create a regular expression that extracts all the words containing 12 or more letters.

3. Create a regular expression that extracts every word that comes after the 'Alice' string, and count the frequency of those words.

4. Create a regular expression that extracts every word that contains five or more letters and comes after the 'Alice' string, and count the frequency of those words.

5. Create a regular expression that extracts every word that contains five or more letters, comes after the 'Alice' string, and does not end in 'ly'. Count the frequency of those words.

### Data Source: 

* `alice.txt` is from [Project Gutenberg eBooks](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and may be used freely in the United States.
