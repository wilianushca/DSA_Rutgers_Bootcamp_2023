# Regex Matching with Pandas

In this activity, you’ll load a text dataset from *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* and then use regular expressions to find matching text.

## Instructions

1. Load the "Sherlock" text into a DataFrame named `sherlock_df`.

2. Create regular expression patterns to find all the lines that contain the following:

    * The word 'Watson'
    * The word 'Watson' followed by a white space character
    * The word 'Watson' followed by a nonword character
    * The word 'Watson' followed by a white space character and then a word character
    * The name of a doctor that includes the "Dr." string
    * A book title that appears in uppercase letters
    * A book title that appears in uppercase letters and that might include a hyphen (`-`)

### Data Source:
