# Filtering

In this activity, you will create a custom function by using `filter()` to return the players who made the team, according to the `roster` dataset. Then, you’ll use that filtered data to determine how many players made the cut.

## Instructions

* Use the starter files `index.html` and `filter.js` provided in the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder.

* Create a custom function to return players who made the team.

* Determine how many players made the cut.
