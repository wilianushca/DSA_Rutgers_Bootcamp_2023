# Hello Variable World

In this activity, you will create variables and console logging strings with template literals.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser to run your code in [HelloVariableWorld.js](Unsolved/HelloVariableWorld.js). Check your code by refreshing your browser.

* Create a variable called `name` that holds your name as a string.

* Create another variable called `title` using a string template to say `"<your name>'s First Plotly Chart"`.

* Create an array called `books` of your favorite book titles.

* Create another array called `timesRead` of how many times you've read each respective book.

* Create a JavaScript object called `myData` with four key-value pairs:

  1. `name`
  2. `favoriteBooks`
  3. `timesRead`
  4. `age`


* Use console.log() to print `myData` to the console. Explore the output in the Chrome console.

## Bonus

In `myData`, consolidate the `favoriteBooks` and `timesRead` into one key called `books` where the value is another javascript object, with keys `titles` and `timesRead`.
