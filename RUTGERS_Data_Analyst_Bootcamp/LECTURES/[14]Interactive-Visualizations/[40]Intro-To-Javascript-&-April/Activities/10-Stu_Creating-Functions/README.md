# Statistical Functions

In this activity, you'll create functions that will calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a dataset.

## Instructions

* Using the movie array provided in the [starter code file](Unsolved/static/js/app.js), create functions that will return statistical values from any given array of data.

  * `movieScore = [4.4, 3.3, 5.9, 8.8, 1.2, 5.2, 7.4, 7.5, 7.2, 9.7, 4.2, 6.9]`

* Create functions that will find the following:

  * Mean
  * Variance
  * Standard deviation

* Each function should `console.log` both the name of the statistic used and its value. For example, "The Mean is: 33.3".

* The functions should be able to take any array of numbers and return the statistical value.

* After you have the functions working with the movie dataset, run them on the following additional data points:

  * `monthlyAvgRainFall = [3.03, 2.48, 3.23, 3.15, 4.13, 3.23]`
  * `mileRunTimes = [5.06, 4.54, 5.56, 4.40, 7.10]`

## Hint

* Remember to open your [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in Chrome and check the DevTools console as you proceed.

* Use the JavaScript Math library to handle calculations needing exponents or square roots.

* If you want to review how to calculate variance and standard deviation, see the following pages:
