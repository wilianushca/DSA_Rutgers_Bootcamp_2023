# Preprocessing Data with Functions for Plotly

In this activity, you will create functions that preprocess films from the Pagila database and create a bar chart of average values by content rating.

## Instructions

* Using the [films.js](Unsolved/films.js) array of movies from the Pagila database, and the starter file [plots.js](Unsolved/plots.js), create a function that will calculate averages by content rating (i.e., G, PG, PG-13, and R) of one of the following metrics:

  * Rental rate (`rental_rate`)
  * Length (`length`)
  * Replacement cost (`replacement_cost`)

* With the calculated averages, create a function that will generate a Plotly bar chart with the average values.

* After you have the functions working, try changing the metric to update the bar chart.

* Remember to use [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) to view your bar chart as you progress with your code.

## Hint

You will need to use conditionals, loops, and functions to complete this activity. You may find it helpful to review the following two activities:

* [06-Stu_Iteration_and_Conditionals](../06-Stu_Iteration_and_Conditionals)

* [10-Stu_Creating-Functions](../10-Stu_Creating-Functions)
