# My First Plotly Chart

In this activity, you will create your first Plotly bar chart by using the variables you created in the previous activity. Your chart will show three books you've read as well as the number of times you've read them.

## Instructions

    * `name`
    * `title`
    * `books`
    * `timesRead`

* In the Plotly `trace1` object, assign the correct `x` and `y` values for a vertical bar chart.

* Open the [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) file to see your first Plotly bar chart.
