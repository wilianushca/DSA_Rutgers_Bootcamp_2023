# Regulation Deep Dive

In this activity, you'll select one of the regulations you have learned about, review it with your group, and find an example of when this regulation was violated.

## Instructions

1. Recall your chosen regulation to research:

  * California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA)

  * Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)&mdash;children

  * Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA)&mdash;communications

  * Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA)&mdash;finance

  * Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)&mdash;education

  * Federal Trade Commission (FTC Act), Section 5

  * General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

  * Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA)&mdash;finance

  * Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)&mdash;healthcare

2. As a group, discuss what your chosen regulation governs, and summarize what this rule requires of the people and organizations that must follow it.

3. Type the name of your rule followed by “violation” in your preferred search engine. If the search engine has a way to specifically search for news articles, use that to help narrow down your search.

4. In your group, share what you find. Then, as a group, decide on a violation to discuss. For this violation, answer the following questions:

    * Who violated the rule?

    * What specific aspect of the rule did they violate?

    * Who was responsible for enforcing the rule when it was violated?

    * How did that responsible person or organization enforce the rule?

    * Do you agree with how the rule was enforced? Do you think the punishment was fair?

5. Choose someone from your group to share a summary of your discussion.

6. If time permits, either discuss another violation of your chosen rule or research violations of a different rule from the list in Step 1.
