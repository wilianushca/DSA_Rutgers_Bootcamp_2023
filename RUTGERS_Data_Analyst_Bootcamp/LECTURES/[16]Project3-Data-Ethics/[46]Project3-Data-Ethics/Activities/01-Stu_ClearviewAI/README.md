# Clearview AI

In this activity, you’ll review and discuss the ways that Clearview AI obtains and uses information about people for its facial recognition tool.

[Clearview AI](https://www.clearview.ai/) is a US-based software company that, according to its website, has "developed a revolutionary, web-based intelligence platform for law enforcement to use as a tool to help generate high-quality investigative leads."

This platform, which uses facial recognition technology, "includes the largest known database of 10+ billion facial images sourced from public-only web sources, including news media, mugshot websites, public social media, and other open sources.​"

Since it was founded in 2017, Clearview AI has been controversial. It has faced many legal challenges that frequently centered around its database of images of faces. It collected these images from public sources without the consent of the people whose faces are represented in the dataset.

2. Discuss the following questions with your group:

    * How do you feel about Clearview AI storing images of your face in its database?

    * Does the availability of images online make them OK to use in the way that Clearview AI is using them? Should this be legal?

    * Does the ability of Clearview AI to support criminal investigations justify the way that it infringes on individual privacy?

    * Given what you learned about issues with facial recognition accuracy from the [Gender Shades project](http://gendershades.org/overview.html), do you have any concerns about Clearview AI misidentifying certain types of people?

    * Do you think the fines that were levied against Clearview AI will change how it does business? Do you think that the fines were appropriate?

3. Be prepared to share insights from your discussion with the rest of the class.
